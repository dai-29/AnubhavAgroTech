AnubhavAgroTech is an innovative GitHub project centered around a comprehensive Crop Recommendation System and real-time Weather Forecast integration. Designed with a focus on enhancing agricultural practices, the project utilizes machine learning to provide tailored crop recommendations based on key parameters. Users input specific values for Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, Temperature, Humidity, pH, and Rainfall through a user-friendly web interface. Leveraging Python as the primary programming language, the system incorporates HTML and CSS for seamless interaction.

The core of the project lies in the utilization of various Python libraries, streamlining the machine learning implementation and ensuring the accuracy of crop recommendations. The machine learning model, embedded within the system, analyzes the input data to suggest the most suitable crops for cultivation. Additionally, the project offers a Weather Forecast feature, allowing users to access real-time weather information for a particular city. This dual functionality empowers farmers and agriculture enthusiasts by providing a holistic solution for informed decision-making. AnubhavAgroTech is not just a technological marvel; it is a practical tool bridging the gap between modern technology and traditional agriculture, contributing to sustainable and efficient farming practices.
